# deepposekit-in-TensorFlow 2

This code is an adaptation of the original [DeepPoseKit](https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit), developed for TensorFlow 1, to function seamlessly within TensorFlow 2. [DeepPoseKit, a software toolkit for fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning](https://elifesciences.org/articles/47994) as described in the paper facilitates fast and robust animal pose estimation using deep learning models.
